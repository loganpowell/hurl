you could use metaStream as part of this, e.g.

```js

events = stream();
events
  .transform(fsm(...))
  .subscribe(metaStream((x) => isPromise(x) : fromPromise(x) : fromIterableSync([x]))
  .subscribe(trace())

```

TOXI: actually... slight correction needed: if your FSM produces promises, you'll need to return them as [[promise1, promise2...]] and then use fromPromises()  (plural, https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/blob/99e4968c51f00491df04286565b65fd9de092e0d/packages/rstream/src/from/promises.ts) in the metaStream...
also need to update that isPromise() check...

ME: so, wrap all non-promise vals as promises and keep promises as-is and then line them up...?

in principle yes, but again, this will have back pressure isues....

you mean there'll be blocking on the main thread waiting for the promises to resolve...

if your FSM always produces promises, then it's probably better to use a resolve() subscription than metaStream

have a look at the docs: https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/blob/99e4968c51f00491df04286565b65fd9de092e0d/packages/rstream/src/metastream.ts

so, this would be better (possibly):

```js

events = stream();
events
  .transform(fsm(...))
  .subscribe(resolve())
  .subscribe(trace())

```
